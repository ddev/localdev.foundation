## DDEV Support and User-Contributed Documentation

We love to hear from our community and help them be successful with DDEV. Support options include:

* Lots of built-in help: `ddev help` and `ddev help <command>`. You'll find examples and explanations.
* [DDEV Documentation](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/faq/)
* [DDEV Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ddev) for support and frequently asked questions. We respond quite quickly here and the results provide quite a library of user-curated solutions.
* [DDEV issue queue](https://github.com/drud/ddev/issues) for bugs and feature requests
* The `#ddev` channels in [Drupal Slack](https://www.drupal.org/slack), [TYPO3 Slack](https://my.typo3.org/index.php?id=35) for interactive, immediate community support.
* [ddev-contrib](https://github.com/drud/ddev-contrib) repo provides a number of vetted user-contributed recipes for extending and using DDEV. Your contributions are welcome.
* [awesome-ddev](https://github.com/drud/awesome-ddev) repo has loads of external resources, blog posts, recipes, screencasts, and the like. Your contributions are welcome.
* [Twitter with tag #ddev](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ddev&src=typd&f=live) will get to us, but it's not as good for interactive support, but we'll answer anywhere.
